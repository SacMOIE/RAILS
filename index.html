          <h2>Making Sacramento a Platform for Startups:</h2>


          <h3>RAILS Grants</h3>


          <p class="intro-text">The newly created Mayor's Office of Innovation
          and Entrepernuership has launched the RAILS program to develop the
          infrastructure needed in Sacramento to help develop, grow, and scale
          local startups. Through a mix of <b>grant-making</b>,
          <b>networking</b>, and <b>hands-on support</b>, we are here to give
          your organization the tools it needs to make Sacramento an even
          better place to start up.</p>


          <p class="intro-text">The city has allocated roughly <b>$1.5M</b> to
          help those organizations already helping the startup ecosystem do
          even more.</p>

          <h3><a href="#acceleration">Acceleration</a>
          </h3>


          <p>Good entreprenuers rely on other ones. We're looking for
          <b>accelerator</b> or <b>incubator</b> programs, based in Sacramento,
          focused on Sacramento, that can help take startups to the next level
          -- be that fundraising, hiring, sales/marketing, or anything

          seeking to learn how to code. Proven programs exist, and we want to
          help them expand their reach in Sacramento for more participation,

          <p>The Mayor's Office is creating a Technology, Innovation, and
          Entrepreneurship Council (MTIEC). Even at the first planning meeting,
          over 60 local entrepernuers, investors, and leaders came together and
          agreed on two thing: <b>there's something special happening here</b>
          -- ranging from new startups springing up to established ones
          raisings rounds and scaling -- and that <b>we all should work
          together</b> to capitalize on this moment to put Sacramento on the
          map.</p>

          <h3>City Hall Opening its Doors</h3>


          <p>It's too often that it's said that impossible to work with the
          city. That's changing. Sacramento is opening up its data as fodder
          for new companies, placing city staff in co-working space around
          town, and even identifying challenges they see in their day-to-day
          jobs, which -- when solved -- could become scaleable businesses that
          work for not just a city, but every city. The door's open; come
          in.</p>

      <h2>Acceleration Partnerships</h2>


      <p>A challenge that's been identified by leading entrepernuers in
      Sacramento is the need for "follow on" funding — that is, capital to grow
      their business, while staying in the area. Accelerator and incubator
      programs are designed to support startups take that next step through
      mentorship, networking with investors, and business development. We're
      seeking Sacramento-based acceleration programs that'll help
      Sacramento-built companies not just stay in Sacramento, but grow to
      scale.</p>

      <h2>Innovation Partnerships</h2>


      <p>Organizations such as Code for America have shown that there's a new
      way for cities to approach technology: instead of drawn-out RFPs, cities
      can turn to nimble civic startups, technology non-profits, and community
      organizations/volunteers. Innovation partners will either directly
      deliver great civic technology for Sacramento (city hall and the
      communtiy) or provide the resources and support they need to become
      sustainable (eg co-working space, mentorship, etc).</p>

      <h2>Leadership Partnerships</h2>


      <p>RAILS aims to support more than just one or two startups or
      organizations this year, but create a pipeline for entrepernuers for
      years to come. That means investing in training programs — such as the
      national organizations, Girls Who Code, RailsBridge, Code2050 — that
      bring in new entrants into the technology space and give them the skills,
      business or technical, to turn their ideas into products and then their
      products into companies. And in particular, we hope to support such
      organizations in Sacramento that serve <b>all</b> of Sacramento:
      geographically, ethnically,</p>
