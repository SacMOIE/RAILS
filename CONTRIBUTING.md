## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to our open source project from the City of Sacramento's Mayor's Office of Innovation! We are big fans of the federal government's 18F initiative, so we're borrowing heavily from their great open source guidlines for open source projects:

Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md), and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway.
